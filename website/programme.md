# Programme

## AI for Nuclear Thermal Hydraulics Summer School  
**13–17 July 2026 | STFC Daresbury Laboratory**

---

## Pre-Work

Self-learning technical onboarding pack with virtual organiser support.

**Supporters:** Dr Wei Wang, Dr Yu Duan

Purpose: remove setup friction, support dataset orientation, align terminology and data structure, confirm the CHF case-study files and notebook structure, verify package imports and data access, and introduce the train domain / prediction domain / unsafe domain framing.

Complete before Day 1.

Outputs: run the starter notebook and sanity-check cells, produce one simple data plot, and confirm tools and data work correctly.

## Common Guidance

All lab sessions are designed to run on standard laptops, using prepared notebooks and a shared CHF case study. Each afternoon starts with a short guided orientation, then moves into a core hands-on task that all participants should be able to complete, followed by a supported extension activity for those ready to go further.

Across the week, participants will be encouraged to work in a steady engineering workflow: inspect the data first, check whether the prediction task is in-domain, build a simple model before a more complex one, and discuss limitations before interpreting results. TAs will support setup, troubleshooting, and pacing during all hands-on blocks.
